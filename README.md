# Hostel_Management_System
The Hostel Management System is a project designed to simplify the management of a hostel. The system caters to two types of users: the admin and the students. The admin has special privileges and can perform tasks like adding and deleting students, viewing and updating student information, handling complaints, and calculating bills. On the other hand, students can view and update their profiles, check their fees, leave the hostel, add complaints, and view the menu. Let's discuss each component in detail.

Features of the Program:
1. User Authentication: Implement a login system to ensure that only authorized users (admins and students) can access the system.
2. Student Registration: Allow the admin to add new students to the system by entering their details such as name, CNIC number, contact information, and Number of rooms.
3. Student Information Management: Enable the admin to view, update, and delete student records, including personal information, contact details, and room allocation.
4. Complaint Management: Provide a functionality for students to add complaints.
5. Fee Management: Implement a mechanism to calculate and track student fees, including room rent, mess charges, and any additional fees.
6. Menu Management: Allow the admin to update and manage the menu, providing students with the ability to view the meals being served on a particular day.
7. User Interface: Design a user-friendly interface for both the admin and students.
